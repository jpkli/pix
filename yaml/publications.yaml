  abstract: 'Analyzing large and complex datasets for critical decision making can benefit from a collective effort involving a team of analysts.
  However, insights and findings from different analysts are often incomplete, disconnected, or even conflicting.
  Most existing analysis tools lack proper support for examining and resolving the conflicts among the findings in order to consolidate the results of collaborative data analysis.
  In this paper, we present CoVA, a visual analytics system incorporating conflict detection and resolution for supporting asynchronous collaborative data analysis.
  By using a declarative visualization language and graph representation for managing insights and insight provenance, CoVA effectively leverages distributed revision control workflow from software engineering to automatically detect and properly resolve conflicts in collaborative analysis results.
  In addition, CoVA provides an effective visual interface for resolving conflicts as well as combining the analysis results.
  We conduct a user study to evaluate CoVA for collaborative data analysis.
  The results show that CoVA allows better understanding and use of the findings from different analysts.'

  abstract: 'Understanding and tuning the performance of extreme-scale parallel computing systems 
  demands a streaming approach due to the computational cost of applying offline algorithms to 
  vast amounts of performance log data. Analyzing large streaming data is challenging because 
  the rate of receiving data and limited time to comprehend data make it difficult for the analysts to 
  sufficiently examine the data without missing important changes or patterns. To support streaming 
  data analysis, we introduce a visual analytic framework comprising of three modules: data management, 
  analysis, and interactive visualization. The data management module collects various computing and 
  communication performance metrics from the monitored system using streaming data processing techniques 
  and feeds the data to the other two modules. The analysis module automatically identifies important 
  changes and patterns at the required latency. In particular, we introduce a set of online and progressive 
  analysis methods for not only controlling the computational costs but also helping analysts better 
  follow the critical aspects of the analysis results. Finally, the interactive visualization module provides 
  the analysts with a coherent view of the changes and patterns in the continuously captured performance data. 
  Through a multi-faceted case study on performance analysis of parallel discrete-event simulation, 
  we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for identifying bottlenecks and locating outliers.'

  abstract: 'We present P5, a web-based visualization toolkit that combines declarative visualization grammar and GPU computing for progressive data analysis and visualization. To interactively analyze and explore big data, progressive analytics and visualization methods have recently emerged. Progressive visualizations of incrementally refining results have the advantages of allowing users to steer the analysis process and make early decisions. P5 leverages declarative grammar for specifying visualization designs and exploits GPU computing to accelerate progressive data processing and rendering. The declarative specifications can be modified during progressive processing to create different visualizations for analyzing the intermediate results. To enable user interactions for progressive data analysis, P5 utilizes the GPU to automatically aggregate and index data based on declarative interaction specifications to facilitate effective interactive visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of P5 through a variety of example applications and several performance benchmark tests.'

  abstract: 'To optimize the performance and efficiency of HPC applications, programmers and analysts often need to collect various performance metrics for each computer at different time points as well as the communication data between the computers. This results in a complex dataset that consists of multivariate time-series and communication network data, which makes debugging and performance tuning of HPC applications challenging. Automated analytical methods based on statistical analysis and unsupervised learning are often insufficient to support such tasks without the background knowledge from the application programmers. To better explore and analyze a wide spectrum of HPC datasets, effective visual data analytics techniques are needed. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for analyzing HPC datasets produced by parallel discrete-event simulations (PDES). Our framework leverages automated time-series analysis methods and effective visualizations to analyze both multivariate time-series and communication network data. Through several case studies for analyzing the performance of PDES, we show that our visual analytics techniques and system can be effective in reasoning multiple performance metrics, temporal behaviors of the simulation, and the communication patterns.'

  abstract: We present P4, an information visualization toolkit that combines declarative design specification and GPU computing for building high-performance interactive systems. Most of the existing information visualization toolkits do not harness the power of parallel processors in today's mainstream computers. P4 leverages GPU computing to accelerate both data processing and visualization rendering for interactive visualization applications. P4's programming interface offers a declarative visualization grammar for rapid specifications of data transformations, visual encodings, and interactions. By simplifying the development of GPU-accelerated visualization systems while supporting a high degree of flexibility and customization for design specification, P4 narrows the gap between expressiveness and scalability in information visualization toolkits. Through a range of examples and benchmark tests, we demonstrate that P4 provides high efficiency for creating interactive visualizations and offers drastic performance improvement over current state-of-the-art toolkits.

  abstract: 'The overall efficiency of an extreme-scale supercomputer largely relies on the performance of its network interconnects. Several of the state of the art supercomputers use networks based on the increasingly popular Dragonfly topology. It is crucial to study the behavior and performance of different parallel applications running on Dragonfly networks in order to make optimal system configurations and design choices, such as job scheduling and routing strategies. However, in order to study these temporal network behavior, we would need a tool to analyze and correlate numerous sets of multivariate time-series data collected from the Dragonfly’s multi-level hierarchies. This paper presents such a tool–a visual analytics system–that uses the Dragonfly network to investigate the temporal behavior and optimize the communication performance of a supercomputer. We coupled interactive visualization with time-series analysis methods to help reveal hidden patterns in the network behavior with respect to different parallel applications and system configurations. Our system also provides multiple coordinated views for connecting behaviors observed at different levels of the network hierarchies, which effectively helps visual analysis tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system with a set of case studies. Our system and findings can not only help improve the communication performance of supercomputing applications, but also the network performance of next-generation supercomputers.'

  abstract: 'High-radix, low-diameter, hierarchical networks based on the Dragonfly topology are common picks for building next generation HPC systems. However, effective tools are lacking for analyzing the network performance and exploring the design choices for such emerging networks at scale. In this paper, we present visual analytics methods that couple data aggregation techniques with interactive visualizations for analyzing large-scale Dragonfly networks. We create an interactive visual analytics system based on these techniques. To facilitate effective analysis and exploration of network behaviors, our system provides intuitive, scalable visualizations that can be customized to show various traffic characteristics and correlate between different performance metrics. Using high-fidelity network simulation and HPC applications communication traces, we demonstrate the usefulness of our system with several case studies on exploring network behaviors at scale with different workloads, routing strategies, and job placement policies. Our simulations and visualizations provide valuable insights for mitigating network congestion and inter-job interference.'

  abstract: 'Many data problems in the real world are complex and require multiple analysts working together to uncover embedded insights by creating chart‐driven data stories. How, as a subsequent analysis step, do we interpret and learn from these collections of charts? We present Chart Constellations, a system to interactively support a single analyst in the review and analysis of data stories created by other collaborative analysts. Instead of iterating through the individual charts for each data story, the analyst can project, cluster, filter, and connect results from all users in a meta‐visualization approach. Constellations supports deriving summary insights about prior investigations and supports the exploration of new, unexplored regions in the dataset. To evaluate our system, we conduct a user study comparing it against data science notebooks. Results suggest that Constellations promotes the discovery of both broad and high‐level insights, including theme and trend analysis, subjective evaluation, and hypothesis generation.'

  abstract: 'HPC systems have shifted to burst buffer storage and high radix interconnect topologies in order to meet the challenges of large-scale, data-intensive scientific computing. Both of these technologies have been studied in detail independently, but the interaction between them is not well understood. I/O traffic and communication traffic from concurrently scheduled applications may interfere with each other in unexpected ways, and this behavior may vary considerably depending on resource allocation, scheduling, and routing policies. In this work, we analyze I/O and network traffic interference on burst-buffer-equipped dragonfly-based systems using the high-resolution packet-level simulations provided by the CODES storage and interconnect simulation framework. The analysis is performed using realistic I/O workload sizes, a variety of resource allocation and network routing strategies employed in production environments, and a dragonfly network configuration modeled after current vendor options. We analyze the impact of interference on both I/O and communication traffic. We observe that although average network packet latency is stable across a wide variety of configurations, the maximum network packet latency in the presence of concurrent I/O traffic is highly sensitive to subtle policy changes. Our simulations reveal a worst-case single packet latency of 4,700 times the average latency for sub-optimal configurations. While a topology-aware mapping of compute nodes to burst buffer storage nodes can minimize the variation in maximum packet latency, it can slow down the I/O traffic by creating contention on the burst buffer nodes. Overall, balancing I/O and network performance requires careful selection of routing, data placement, and job placement policies.'
