introductions:
  - > 
    I am a PhD candidate in computer science at the <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>, 
    where I work with <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ma">Kwan-Liu Ma</a> 
    and the Visualization and Interface Design and Innovation (<a href="https://vidi.cs.ucdavis.edu/">VIDI</a>) Lab. 

  - >
    I research and innovate at the interaction of visualization, data mining, and high-performance computing, 
    aiming to enable scalable and interactive visualization of big data for everyone.
    I also create tools that integrate machine learning and data visualizations to help people understand 
    complex information and discover new knowledge.
